#XO game
A new Flutter project.
XO Game (Tic Tac Toe) – Flutter

The XO Game, also known as Tic Tac Toe, is a simple yet engaging Flutter application designed to deliver a fun two-player gaming experience with an attractive and responsive user interface. Built entirely using Flutter and Dart, this project showcases essential front-end development skills such as layout design, state management, and logical event handling.

The app features a 3x3 interactive game board, where two players alternately place their symbols (‘X’ and ‘O’). The system intelligently checks for winning conditions after every move, highlights the winner, and also detects a draw when all cells are filled without a winner. The interface is clean, responsive, and optimized for both Android and iOS, ensuring a smooth gameplay experience across devices.

Key features include real-time turn indication, winner and draw detection logic, restart functionality, and a visually appealing UI built using Material Design principles. The game’s logic is implemented efficiently using simple data structures, and state changes are handled seamlessly with Flutter’s setState() method.

This project is a perfect example of combining UI design and logical programming to build an enjoyable, interactive application. Future enhancements can include adding an AI opponent for single-player mode, integrating animations or sound effects, and implementing online multiplayer support.
